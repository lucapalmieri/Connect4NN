# Connect4NN

Project work for course of Foundations Of Artificial Intelligence at University of Bologna.

To view and download datasets used to train the Neural Network (20k_minmax.csv, 100k.csv, 500k.csv, 2000k.csv), follow the link below:

There are 5 type of players:
- HUMAN: you can choose where put the piece in the board
- AI_RANDOM: cpu player, choose randomly between avaiable columns
- AI_MINMAX: cpu player, minmax alghoritm choose the column
- AI_NN: cpu player, a Neural Network trained (with different dataset) choose the best column 
- AI_NN_NON_DET: cpu player, a Neural Network trained (with different dataset) choose where to put the piece in the board in a non deterministic way
